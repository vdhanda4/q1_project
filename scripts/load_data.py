Neo4j Biomedical Knowledge Graph Data Loader

This script populates a Neo4j graph database with structured biomedical data
including genes, proteins, diseases, drugs, and their complex relationships.
It creates a comprehensive knowledge graph suitable for AI-powered biomedical
query systems and research applications.

The script handles:
- Entity creation (genes, proteins, diseases, drugs)
- Relationship establishment (encodes, treats, targets, associations)
- Database constraints for data integrity
- Derived relationship computation (gene-disease links)
- Complete database rebuild with cleanup

Data Sources:
    Reads CSV files from the data/ directory:
    - genes.csv: Gene entities with chromosomal and functional information
    - proteins.csv: Protein entities with structural data
    - diseases.csv: Disease entities with prevalence and severity data
    - drugs.csv: Drug entities with approval status and mechanisms
    - protein_disease_associations.csv: Protein-disease relationships
    - drug_disease_treatments.csv: Drug treatment relationships
    - drug_protein_targets.csv: Drug-protein target interactions

Usage:
    python scripts/load_data.py

Environment Variables:
    NEO4J_URI: Database connection URI (default: bolt://localhost:7687)
    NEO4J_USER: Database username (default: neo4j)
    NEO4J_PASSWORD: Database password (required)

    A comprehensive data loader for populating Neo4j with biomedical knowledge
    graph data.

    This class manages the complete process of loading structured biomedical data
    into a Neo4j graph database. It handles entity creation, relationship establishment,
    constraint management, and data integrity verification.

    The loader creates a knowledge graph with the following schema:
    - Nodes: Gene, Protein, Disease, Drug
    - Relationships: ENCODES, ASSOCIATED_WITH, TREATS, TARGETS, LINKED_TO

    Features:
    - Transactional loading with proper error handling
    - Database constraint creation for performance optimization
    - Automated derived relationship computation
    - Complete database rebuilding capability
    - Progress logging throughout the loading process

            This derived relationship enables direct gene-disease queries.

        Query Pattern:
            MATCH (gene)-[:ENCODES]->(protein)-[:ASSOCIATED_WITH]->(disease)
            CREATE (gene)-[:LINKED_TO]->(disease)

        Note:
            Only creates new relationships where none exist to avoid duplicates.
            Should be called after all entities and direct relationships are loaded.

    Main entry point for loading biomedical knowledge graph data into Neo4j.

    This function orchestrates the complete data loading process:
    1. Establishes database connection using environment variables
    2. Clears existing data for fresh loading
    3. Creates database constraints for performance
    4. Loads all entity types (genes, proteins, diseases, drugs)
    5. Establishes all relationship types
    6. Computes derived relationships
    7. Handles errors gracefully with proper cleanup

    Environment Variables Required:
        NEO4J_PASSWORD: Database password (required)
        NEO4J_URI: Database URI (optional, defaults to bolt://localhost:7687)
        NEO4J_USER: Database username (optional, defaults to neo4j)

    Data Loading Order:
        The loading follows dependency order to ensure referential integrity:
        1. Entities: Genes → Proteins → Diseases → Drugs
        2. Direct relationships: Gene-Protein, Protein-Disease, Drug-Disease,
                                Drug-Protein
        3. Derived relationships: Gene-Disease links
