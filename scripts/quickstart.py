configured and functional. It performs comprehensive setup checks, database
connectivity testing, and demonstrates core functionality through sample queries.

The script validates:
- Environment variable configuration
- Neo4j database connection and data availability
- Basic query execution through the GraphInterface
- System readiness for interactive use

Usage:
    python scripts/quickstart.py

Prerequisites:
    - Neo4j database running with biomedical data loaded
    - Environment variables configured in .env file
    - Required Python dependencies installed

Environment Variables Required:
    NEO4J_PASSWORD: Password for Neo4j database
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: API key for Anthropic Claude (for AI agent features)
    NEO4J_URI: Database URI (optional, defaults to bolt://localhost:7687)

    Test Neo4j database connectivity and verify data availability.

    This function establishes a connection to the Neo4j database and performs
    a basic query to verify both connectivity and data presence. The test helps
    identify common setup issues before attempting complex operations.

    Connection Test:
        1. Establishes database connection using environment variables
        2. Executes a simple node count query
        3. Verifies that biomedical data is available
        4. Properly closes the connection

    The queries test various relationship types and demonstrate the system's
    capability to retrieve meaningful biomedical information.

    Sample Query Types:

        2. Drug Treatments: "What drugs treat hypertension?"
        3. Gene-Protein Encoding: "What protein does gene encode?"

    Each query demonstrates:
