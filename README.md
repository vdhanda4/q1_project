## What You'll Learn

- **Knowledge Graphs**: Represent domain knowledge as nodes and relationships
- **LangGraph**: Build multi-step AI workflows with state management  
- **Cypher Queries**: Query graph databases effectively
- **AI Integration**: Combine language models with structured knowledge
- **Biomedical Applications**: Apply AI to drug discovery and personalized medicine

## Quick Start

1. **New to these concepts?** Read the [Foundations Guide](docs/foundations-and-background.md)
2. **Setup**: Follow [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) for installation
3. **Learn**: Use the interactive Streamlit web interface
4. **Practice**: Work through the exercises in the web app
